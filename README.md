## Using the app

Create an account by clicking on 'Sign Up' on the navbar. Once you are logged in you will be able to browse through TV shows and movies seperated by genres. Hover over a card to see the title, a synopsis, and the like button. Clicking the 'like' button will add that show or movie into your favorites list. Once you have a favorite, a list of recommendations will generate at the top of the screen. The recommendations list will display the highest rated movies or shows at a ratio that matches the ratio of genres in your favorites list. The navbar has links to your favorites, links to browse by individual genres of either TV shows or movies, and a drop down form to edit your username. The navbar also has a search bar to search for content based on titles.
